        <p>Like most growing up in the 21st century, Nicholas has long been around computers, from the Nintendo Wii to
            the iPod, all the way to his very own custom-build gaming PC (CPU: Ryzen 5 2600 6-core, 3.4GHz, GPU: Nividia
            RTX 2060
            6GB GDDR6, RAM: 16gb DDR4 3200MHz, STORAGE: SABRENT 256GB NVMe SSD, PSU: Corsair CX650M, Case: Cooler Master
            MasterBox Q300L Micro-ATX Tower). Although computers and coding fasinated him, He never knew where to start,
            so longingly he would look over his brother's shoulder, wondering what all the jibberish on the screen
            meant. He did manage to become quite fluent in Scratch though, making many slideshow presentations and a
            game
            titled <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/150429799/">StarTravel</a>.</p>
        <p>Then came his junior year, in which he took the A level computer science class - which was not all fun &
            games and a lot of work. Soon
            Nicholas Realized that there is a difference between using computer programs and creating computer programs.
            But he did accept the challenge of coding, and after taking the AP Computer Science course and some
            online tutorials (<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> being the best one) is well
            on his way to earning his bachlors of science in CIS with a concentration of Web
            Development at Messiah University. He
            tolerates working in Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript.</p>
