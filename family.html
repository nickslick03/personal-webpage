        <p>Nicholas' family has made him who he is. Well, his family and StarFox 64. Here's the lineup:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Michael Epps</dt>
            <dd>Nicholas' charasmatic yet down-to-earth Father. He loves talking to all kinds of people and hearing
                their
                stories and his ultimate goal in life is to be offered a cup of coffee from a stranger, chating with
                them
                on their front porch. He and Nicholas enjoy camping, mountain biking, and entering grades in Genesis
                together.</dd>
            <dt>Larisa Epps</dt>
            <dd>Detail-oriented, family-oriented, and musically-oriented; Nicholas has the best mother in the world. She
                has reared him and his siblings through countless chores, many a school assignments, years of violin
                lessons and so much more. All without drinking coffee. She and Nicholas enjoy playing the violin
                together and playing Bananagrams (unless she wins, which she usually does).</dd>
            <dt>Nathanael Epps</dt>
            <dd>Nicholas' older brother is the laziest (or most efficient) programmer. He is currently writing
                his own <a href="https://github.com/NateEpps/ncc4">C++ Compiler</a>
                that will put GNU to shame. These two keep it real with a game
                of Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies, Grilling kabobs, or crusing downtown with the top down.</dd>
            <dt>Catherine Epps</dt>
            <dd>Catherine is the artist of the family, having made name for herself in the competitive illustration
                scene of
                Philadelphia with her debut comicbook <em>lil and friend die for real</em>. She makes a mean bacon mac
                'n' cheese and plays a mean yoshi in Mario Kart 8.</dd>
            <dt>Christian Epps</dt>
            <dd>The youngest of the family, this 6<sup>th</sup> grader bangs on his keyboard after losing in Roblox
                almost as hard as he bangs on the drums. He also enjoys a good Redwall book next to a fire, with a nice
                glass of
                <span lang="es">jugo de naranja.</span>
