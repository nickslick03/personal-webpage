        <p>The violin was Nicholas' 1<sup>st</sup> instrument and may be his only instrument (besides <a
                href="choir.html">singing</a>). He doesn't mind, since the violin is really stinkin' hard and he will
            always need to practice. He started playing as soon as he could walk, with his <a
                href="https://www.facebook.com/TheViolinStudio/">mother</a> as his teacher. Growing up listening to lots
            of classical music, Nicholas has come to enjoy the many great works he was taught.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Joined YOCJ in the fall of 2016, where he played a variety of orchestral works. He played in all the
            orchestras the program had to offer from String Prepatory, to Pro Arte, to Symphony Orchesta. His favorite
            piece by far was Dvorak's 9<sup>th</sup> Symphony, which he played his senior year. He sat 5<sup>th</sup>
            chair in the 1<sup>st</sup> violin section of the Symphony Orchestra his senior year.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Currently takes lessons with Peter Sirotin which has a challenging experience (for both parties). He
            loves it through and finds his newfound skills make
            playing in Messiah's Symphony Orchestra an awesome time. Nicholas currently sits 4<sup>th</sup> chair in the
            1<sup>st</sup> Violin section.</p>
