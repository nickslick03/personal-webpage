        <p>Nicholas Has been singing from a very young age, starting In his church, Princeton Allience Church, through
            KEWL praise (now defunct). He took voice lessons throughout elementary and middle school, participated in
            his elementary, middle, and high school choirs, which would not have been possible without Mrs. Hanson, Mrs.
            Yost, Mr. Schneider, and Mrs. Curtin. He also sang in some of the school musicals. He played "Young
            Simba" in Renyolds Middle School's production of "The Lion King Jr." It all went downhill after
            the "cute" factor wore off and his voice dropped; he
            switched to playing violin in the pit orchestra soon after. He now sings bass 2
            in the Messiah Concert Choir. His range is D2 to E4-ish.</p>
